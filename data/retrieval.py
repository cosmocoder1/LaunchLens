"""Fetches raw SpaceX API data and stores it locally as JSON files.

This script downloads data from the public SpaceX REST API v4 for the following endpoints:
- launches
- rockets
- launchpads
- payloads

All responses are saved under the local `data/` directory as prettified JSON files
(e.g., `data/launches.json`) for inspection and offline processing.

Usage:
    python data/retrieval.py

This is intended as the first step in the ETL process for building a normalized SQLite database.
