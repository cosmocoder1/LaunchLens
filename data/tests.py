"""Performs basic validation and inspection of SpaceX API data saved locally in JSON format.

This script assumes that raw data has already been downloaded via `retrieval.py`
and saved under the `data/` directory. It loads each file and:

- Verifies that the file exists and contains valid JSON
- Prints the number of records in each dataset
- Displays a partial, formatted preview of the first launch record

Usage:
    python data/tests.py

This script helps verify that the data ingestion step was successful and
provides a lightweight overview before further processing.
