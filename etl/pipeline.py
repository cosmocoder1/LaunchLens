"""
ETL pipeline for populating the local SQLite database with structured SpaceX launch data.

This module defines the DataPipeline class, which loads raw JSON records from disk and
inserts them into the appropriate tables:
- Rockets
- Launchpads
- Payloads
- Launches
- Launch-Payload join table

All insertions are idempotent and executed within transactions for consistency and reliability.
